Advanced Technology: An 8-inch touchscreen is standard, with a larger 12.3-inch Toyota Audio Multimedia display available on higher trims, supporting wireless Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™. Available features also include a digital key and an 8-speaker JBL® premium audio system.
Comprehensive Safety: All models come standard with the Toyota Safety Sense™ 3.0 suite, which includes features like pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane departure alert with steering assist, and road sign assist.
Improved Performance: The current Prius is significantly more powerful than previous generations, offering quicker acceleration without sacrificing its class-leading fuel efficiency.
Interior Comfort: The cabin is driver-centric with a high-mounted digital gauge cluster to keep information in the driver's line of sight. It features standard cloth or available SofTex®-trimmed, heated and ventilated front seats, and a fixed glass roof is available on the Limited trim. </p>
