        <p>High Specific Output: The F20C engine held the record for the highest specific power output of any mass-produced, naturally aspirated car engine at the time of its release, producing approximately 120 horsepower per liter.
Driver-Focused Interior: The cockpit features a minimalist, race-car-like digital instrument panel and an engine start button, emphasizing functionality over luxury.
Handling & Suspension: Early AP1 models were known for a tendency towards "snap-oversteer" at the limit, which Honda addressed with revised, more forgiving suspension tuning in the 2002 model year and further refinements for the AP2.
Model Variants: In addition to the standard roadster with an electrically powered soft top, a removable aluminum hardtop was available as an option. Special editions like the Club Racer (CR) in the US and the Type S in Japan offered track-oriented enhancements.
Critical Acclaim: The S2000 was highly praised throughout its production run, winning numerous awards including being named on Car and Driver's "Ten Best" list multiple times and topping the BBC Top Gear owner satisfaction survey.</p>
