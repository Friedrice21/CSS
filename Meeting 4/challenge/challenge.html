        <h2>Williams</h2>
        <p>
          Williams Racing is a legendary Formula 1 team founded in 1977 by Sir
          Frank Williams and Patrick Head. Based in Grove, UK, it’s one of the
          most successful independent teams in F1 history, with 9 Constructors’
          Championships and 7 Drivers’ Championships, achieved during its peak
          in the 1980s and 1990s with drivers like Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost,
          and Damon Hill. Today, Williams competes as a midfield team, still
          respected for its heritage, resilience, and role in shaping F1
          engineering innovation.

        <h2>Redbull</h2>
        <p>
          Red Bull Racing is a Formula 1 team founded in 2005 after energy drink
          company Red Bull purchased Jaguar Racing. Based in Milton Keynes, UK,
          it quickly rose to prominence, winning four consecutive Constructors’
          and Drivers’ Championships from 2010 to 2013 with Sebastian Vettel.
          After a brief lull, the team returned to dominance in 2021 with Max
          Verstappen, who has since led Red Bull into a new era of sustained
          success. Known for its aggressive racing style, sharp strategy, and
          strong technical partnership with Adrian Newey, Red Bull is now the
          benchmark team in modern F1.
